    "ai_prompt": "Create high-quality image or video digital assets metadata following these guidelines:\n\n1. Title Requirements:\n- Length: Aim for a concise title around _MIN_LEN_ to _MAX_LEN_ characters (never exceeding _MAX_LEN_). This length performs well in stock search results and avoids truncation.\n- Natural Description: Write the title as a clear, descriptive sentence or phrase – not a list of keywords. It should read organically and introduce the image/video to customers.\n- Key Details: Incorporate the who, what, when, where, and why if relevant. Mention the main subject and context, so buyers immediately grasp the content. Include any notable mood, emotion, or visual style/technique when it’s a defining element.\n- Unique & Specific: Make sure the title is unique to the content and accurately summarizes what’s distinctive about it. Avoid generic statements – be precise and factual. A good title captures the essence of the scene in an objective way, helping it stand out in search results.\n- Length: Min _MIN_LEN_ - Max Length must be exactly _MAX_LEN_ characters, and MUST NOT exceed _MAX_LEN_ under any circumstances. If the title is longer than _MAX_LEN_, it is INVALID and must be shortened.\n\n2. Description Requirements:\n- Detailed and Distinct: Provide a brief but detailed description of the image or video that adds information beyond the title. Use 1–2 sentences to give context or specifics the title couldn’t cover. Ensure it’s unique and informative, not a copy of the title.\n- Concise Clarity: Keep it under _MAX_DESC_LEN_ characters for quick readability. Even in one sentence, include the most important details: the primary subject, setting, action, and any unique characteristics or story element.\n- Natural Language: Write in full sentences with correct grammar, as if describing the image or video to someone. Do not just list keywords or camera settings – the description should flow naturally and appeal to a buyer’s imagination while remaining factual.\n- SEO Considerations: Use a couple of strong keywords or phrases from the title in the description if relevant, to reinforce search visibility, but avoid keyword stuffing. Focus on readability and relevance for the buyer.\n\n3. Keywords Requirements:\n- Exact Count: Provide exactly _TAGS_COUNT_ keywords, no more and no less. Each keyword must be a single word directly related to the content. Separate keywords with commas only – no other punctuation.\n- First 5 Keywords: The first 5 keywords are the most crucial and must be chosen with the highest level of care and seriousness. They must directly represent the core subject, concept, or unique selling point of the image or video. These 5 keywords are critical for search ranking and must not be generic or irrelevant.\n- First 10 Keywords: The first 10 keywords (including the first 5) must strongly reinforce and support the main subject and concept. These keywords should be highly relevant and act as the main SEO drivers, ensuring the content is easily discoverable for its intended purpose.\n- Relevance & Precision: Choose keywords that are highly relevant to the image/video’s subject, context, and concept. Each keyword must precisely describe an element actually visible or depicted – no misleading or unrelated terms. Think of terms a buyer would use to find that exact content.\n- Literal and Conceptual: Include both literal keywords (such as objects, people, setting) and conceptual keywords that convey themes or emotions. This balances concrete details with abstract ideas, covering various search intents.\n- Cover Key Elements: Ensure the keywords together answer: Who/What is in the scene? Where is it? What concepts or mood does it evoke? Include key visual elements, setting or location terms (country, city if relevant and generic), and any important attributes. If the content has a distinctive style or technique, include those as well.\n- Use Industry-Standard Terms: Prefer common, industry-standard terminology over obscure terms so that buyers and search algorithms recognize them. Ensure all keywords are in English and spelled correctly – spelling errors or non-English words can prevent the content from appearing in searches.\n- Prioritize and Order: List keywords in order of importance. Start with the most critical subjects and concepts, as many platforms give more weight to the first 5–10 keywords. Ordering by relevance helps maximize SEO impact.\n- Avoid Overly Generic Terms: Do not use extremely generic keywords that are overly broad or competitive on their own. Instead, use more specific single words.\n- No Redundancy: Each of the _TAGS_COUNT_ keywords should add new information – avoid duplicates or close variations of the same word. The system typically matches singular/plural forms and related words, so use each slot for a different relevant keyword to broaden search reach.\n\n4. General Guidelines:\n- Language: Use only English for all metadata fields (title, description, keywords). This ensures maximum reach since English terms are broadly searched and recognized for global exposure.\n- Accuracy & Honesty: Be truthful and accurate in every detail. Describe what is actually present in the content and its context. Do not guess or invent details. If unsure, leave it out. Accurate metadata builds trust with buyers and improves search performance.\n- Respect and Sensitivity: Use respectful, inclusive language when describing people or cultures. Follow the models’ self-identification if known and avoid assumptions about race, ethnicity, religion, health, or other personal attributes. Never include derogatory or offensive descriptors. Keep descriptions professional and focus on the content’s creative aspects.\n- Commercial Focus: Emphasize elements that highlight the content’s commercial value and usage potential. Think like a buyer or designer searching for an image – what keywords or description would help them find this asset for their project? Align metadata with how the content could be used in marketing, editorial design, advertising, etc., to improve its salability.\n- Clarity and Professionalism: Write in plain, clear English with proper spelling and grammar. Avoid slang, overly flowery language, or marketing hype. Maintain a neutral tone – don’t use first-person or subjective opinions. Proper grammar and capitalization make your metadata look professional and help search engines parse it correctly.\n- No Special Characters: Do not use special characters or symbols in metadata, as they can confuse search algorithms or violate guidelines. The only exception is using commas to separate keywords. Characters like #, @, %, or emoji have no place in stock metadata. Also avoid excessive punctuation or any formatting tags. Keep it plain text.\n- Consistency and Updates: Be consistent in style across the details so buyers know what to expect.\n- Use the filename as additional context if the filename contains relevant information or context about the content. If the filename provides context, incorporate it appropriately into the metadata.\n\n5. Strict Don'ts:\n- No brand names, trademarks, or company names\n- No celebrity names or personal names\n- No specific event references or newsworthy content\n- No copyrighted elements or protected designs\n- No editorial content or journalistic references\n- No offensive, controversial, or sensitive terms\n- No location-specific landmarks unless generic\n- No date-specific references or temporal events\n- No product names or model numbers\n- No camera/tech specifications in metadata\n- No Duplicating Meaning\n- No Product Model Numbers or Tech Specs\n\n6. Uniqueness:\n- This request includes a unique timestamp : _TIMESTAMP_ and token : _TOKEN_, which indicate it is different from any previous request and must always be processed as a fresh, uncached request.\n",
