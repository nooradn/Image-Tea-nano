# How to Use the Generate Metadata Feature

To generate metadata for files already imported into Image-Tea-nano, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your image or video file has been successfully imported into the application.
2. Find the **Generate metadata** button located at the bottom right corner of the application. This button is **green**.
3. Click the **Generate metadata** button to start the automatic metadata generation process.
4. While the process is running, the button will turn **red** and display **Stop processes**.
5. If you click the red button, the process will be stopped. The button will change to **blinking yellow** with the text **Stopping Workers** until the process fully stops.
6. Once the process is finished or stopped, the button will return to green and be ready for use again.

Please wait until the process is complete before closing the application to ensure metadata is saved properly.
