# How to Use the Generate Metadata Feature

To generate metadata for files already imported into Image-Tea-nano, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your image or video file has been successfully imported into the application.
2. Above the **Generate metadata** button (bottom right corner), there is a **combobox** to select the metadata generation mode. Choose the mode according to your needs:

   - **Generate all**: Processes metadata for all files in the list.
   - **Selected only**: Processes metadata only for files that are **checked** in the table (the ones you have selected by ticking the checkbox).
   - **Failed only**: Processes metadata only for files that previously **failed** to process.
3. After selecting the desired mode in the combobox, click the **Generate metadata** button to start the automatic metadata generation process.
4. While the process is running, the button will turn **red** and display **Stop processes**.
5. If you click the red button, the process will be stopped. The button will change to **blinking yellow** with the text **Stopping Workers** until the process fully stops.
6. Once the process is finished or stopped, the button will return to green and be ready for use again.

Please wait until the process is complete before closing the application to ensure metadata is saved properly.
