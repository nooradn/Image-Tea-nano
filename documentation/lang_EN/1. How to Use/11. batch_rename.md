# Batch Rename

After successfully generating metadata, you can automatically rename your files in bulk using the **Batch Rename** feature.

You can access this feature from:
- The main menu: **Edit > Batch Rename**
- The toolbar: **Rename** button

In the Batch Rename dialog, you can:
- Choose to rename all files, only selected files, or use a custom selection.
- Set a custom name, prefix, or suffix.
- Add numbering with a specified number of digits.
- Add timestamp or date to filenames.
- Remove special characters or replace spaces with underscores.
- Select the pattern mode (default or custom) and adjust the filename pattern using variables such as `{prefix}`, `{original}`, `{number}`, `{suffix}`, `{timestamp}`, `{date}`, and `{title}`.
- Use the checklist to include or exclude variables as needed.
- Preview the result before renaming.

After renaming, you can restore the previous filenames using **Undo Rename** if needed.

This feature helps you organize your files efficiently based on the generated metadata and your preferred naming conventions.
