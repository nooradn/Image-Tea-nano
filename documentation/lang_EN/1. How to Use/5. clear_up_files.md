# Clearing Up Files

![Clearing Files](res\images\clear_up_files.png)

To clear files from the Image-Tea-nano database:

- Use the **Edit > Clear All** menu or the **Clear** button on the toolbar to remove all files from the database.
- To delete a single item, select the file and use **Edit > Delete Selected** or the **Delete** button on the toolbar.

Files that are cleared or deleted are only removed from the Image-Tea-nano database, not from your computer. The original files are not deleted or modified, as Image-Tea-nano does not have a feature to delete original files.
