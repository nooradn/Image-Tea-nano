# Importing Files

![Importing Files](res\images\importing_files.png)

To import files in Image-Tea-nano:

1. Open the application.
2. Use the **File > Import Files** option from the main menu, or click the **Import** button on the toolbar.
3. Select the files you want to import. Image-Tea-nano supports all common image formats, including SVG, EPS, and PDF, as well as popular video formats (`.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.flv`, `.mpg`, `.webm`, `.wmv`, `.3gp`, `.3gpp`).

Alternatively, you can also add files by **dragging & dropping** them directly into the main application area:

- Select image or video files from your computer.
- Drag the files to the main window of Image-Tea-nano.
- Drop the files in the application area, and they will be automatically added to the list.

If you need support for a file type that is not currently supported, you can request it in the community.

All imported files will appear in the main table. Image-Tea-nano will automatically read any existing metadata from the files during import.

Imported files are only registered in the Image-Tea-nano database; the original files are not stored in the database and will not be altered unless you perform a metadata writing operation.
