# Adjusting the Parameters

When generating metadata with AI in Image-Tea-nano, you can adjust several parameters to match your needs. These parameters control how the AI generates titles, descriptions, and tags for your files.

Here are the available parameters and their functions:

- **Min Title**: The minimum number of characters for the generated title.
- **Max Title**: The maximum number of characters for the generated title.
- **Max Desc**: The maximum number of characters for the generated description.
- **Tag Count**: The number of tags to generate for each file.
- **Batch Size**: The number of files to process in one batch when sending requests to the API.
- **Compression**: The compression level (in percent) for the cache file sent to the API.  
  - Lower values mean smaller cache file size and more efficient data usage, but may reduce image detail and make it harder for the AI to recognize content.
  - Higher values preserve more detail but use more data.
  - **Recommended setting:** 70â€“80.  
    - **100** means original quality (no compression).
    - **Below 50**: The image will be highly compressed, which may make it difficult for the AI to analyze details.

Adjust these values according to your requirements and the platform you are targeting. For example, some microstock platforms may have specific limits for title or description length, or a maximum number of tags.

Setting the right parameters ensures the generated metadata fits your workflow and meets the requirements of your chosen platforms.
