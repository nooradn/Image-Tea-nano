# Generating Metadata Automatically

To generate metadata automatically for imported files in Image-Tea-nano, make sure you have already added your API key.

Follow these steps:

1. Click the **Generate Metadata** button.  
   The button will change to **Stop Processes**, indicating that Image-Tea-nano is working and sending your files to the API for analysis.  
   Note: Image-Tea-nano does not generate metadata locally; all processing is done via the API.

2. While processing, items in the main table will turn **yellow** to indicate they are being processed.  
   Once finished, successful items will turn **green**.  
   If generation fails, the item will turn **red**.  
   Don't worry if some files fail during the process—you can retry generating metadata for failed files after the process completes.

3. Above the **Generate Metadata** button, there is a dropdown with options:  
   - **Generate All**: Process all files  
   - **Failed Only**: Process only files that previously failed  
   - **Selected Only**: Process only the files you have selected  
   Use these options to efficiently retry or target specific files, especially those that failed before.

After the process is complete, the generated metadata is saved only in the Image-Tea-nano database.  
It is **not yet written to the original files**—so if you clear or reset the database, the metadata will be lost.  
To permanently save metadata to your files, use the write metadata feature.
