# Customizing the Prompt

Image-Tea-nano uses prompts to help AI understand exactly what you want when generating metadata. You can fully customize these prompts to suit your needs.

4. Save your changes.

The default prompt has been optimized for SEO and general use, but you are free to adjust it as needed.

**Prompt Placeholders:**  
Prompt placeholders are special variables that will be replaced automatically when generating metadata. These ensure your prompts always match the current configuration and are unique for every request. The available placeholders are:

- `_MIN_LEN_`: Minimum title length.
- `_MAX_LEN_`: Maximum title length.
- `_MAX_DESC_LEN_`: Maximum description length.
- `_TAGS_COUNT_`: Required number of tags.
- `_TIMESTAMP_`: Unique timestamp for each request.
- `_TOKEN_`: Unique token for each request.

These placeholders allow the application to dynamically insert values based on your settings and ensure the AI generates metadata according to your preferences.

Customizing the prompt gives you full control over how Image-Tea-nano communicates with the AI, ensuring the generated metadata matches your expectations.
